## Greasemonkey "Easy Ban" Script

The workflows to revoke and ban in Wikidot are unintuitive and annoying.

For revokes, the fastest approach is to have someone submit a "user report", go to the abuse section and kick them that way.

For bans, you can either use the above, but this does not let you add a ban reason. So the alternative is to open the ban creation form, which has an extremely poorly-optimized user search with annoying UI properties. This means that this encourages not documenting bans, or requires suffering through a terrible UX experience every time.

Thankfully, the actual ban call itself is comparatively simple, so as long as you have the user ID (which you can get from, for instance, the [More User Info](https://github.com/scpwiki/user-info-script) userscript), then this process can be greatly improved. This is what this [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net) script does:
